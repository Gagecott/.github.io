    <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
    <p>You know, if the link didnt end with ".edu" I wouldnt have believed this was the actual website for the Yale School of Arts. The website features constant clashing colors, inconsistent backgrounds for text, cluttered information aligned to the left of the screen, and so much more. The background isnt a solid color at all, but rather an image (or gif depending on where you go) repeating over and over in the background, which makes the whole website more distraction and hard to navigate. A few things that irk me is the very top of the page being taken up by where the school is located. Usually here is where you'd have links and such leading you to different parts of your website, but thats not the case. Infact you quick links are right below it and in the middle of the screen??? The whole website just looks very shoddy and the variety of colors and information being scattered all over the place makes it truly difficult to naviagate.</p>
    <p><b>C.R.A.P Principles</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The contrast between colors is at least.. alright. Colors contrast well but the gradiant makes the text difficult to read, and some backgrounds on some links clash with you background colors for text boxes.</li>
        <li>There is no repetition in any of the websites design. Colors are constantly changing, as well as the backgrounds and font sizes. Theres barely any consistency.</li>
        <li>For the alignment everything is like.... kinda stuck to the left it feels like? Everything is scrunched up to the left of the screen as if they wanted you to see the repeating image background. </li>
        <li>While everything may be scrunched together, they do seperate items that do not relate to each other with a thick black bar. Keeping everything notable within proximity with eachother. </li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3><a href="https://spotify.design/">Spotify Design</a></h3>
    <p>Spotify Design is like a discovery hub for things on the platform, offering artists to listen to, insight on how the platform is designed, and many more. The website itself is bright, but not oppressive to the point where things get hard to look at, and the artstyle and colors are consistent throughout each tab you explore. Speaking of navigation, every different section of the website is up at the top right. Clicking on each plays a smooth transition, showing you exactly what you need, the design of each tab being different but still consistent within the spotify style. All of the information is neatly organized and within decent proximity of eachother so you can find exactly what you may be looking for.</p>
    <p><b>C.R.A.P Principles</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The bright colors combined with the black text, and dark backgrounds with white text make the perfect contrast, making everything on the site extremely easy to read and comprehend.</li>
        <li>Repetition is very apparent on the site. For instance, if you visit the "Listen" section of the site, the backgrounds for different songs they offer keep the same design with just a variation of colors you see more than once, the only different between the covers being the little doodles featured on them.</li>
        <li>Everything on screen is aligned well and information is grouped up within its relavent spaces. You can very easily find what you need.</li>
        <li>Everything you may need is within close proximity of eachother, making it easy to navigate to what you might need, there is extra information at the bottom of each page, letting you give them your email for updates to the website and other general information to their job website as well as their social medias. They arent as close as the main information on each tab of the site, you do have to scroll a little further to find these things.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Glad you could make it. Come back early and often for updates! :D</p>
