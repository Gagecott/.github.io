These consoles are usually connected to a TV or monitor and the games are controlled using controllers meant for the console. This type of gaming is the most popular way to the more serious and complex side of gaming, as it offers the user high quality games made for the consoles to play from the comfort of their couch. </p>
                    <h3>Mobile games</h3>

            <h3>Why do I enjoy video games?</h3>

            </figure>
            <p> To me, video games are a great way to distract myself from the real world for a bit. Life itself is quite stressful, constantly having to work on assignments for school as well as juggle a job, its nice to be able to sit down for a bit and chill with some of my friends in a game. That and there are very enjoyable games out there for every itch one may have. If you want to sit down and enjoy a really good story, theres games for that, or if your wanting to relieve stress and demolish a bunch of enemies, theres games for that too. Not only that but video games have also led me to having better relationships with the people in my life and even meeting people online, some of which Ive met years ago and still are in contact with. Video games offer a fun break from the stress and scares of the world and can lead people to connect with others online, sharing unforgetable experiences and moments with one another that can stick with you for the rest of your life.</p>
            <p>In fact, online freindships caused by video games have such a hold on some people, its led to people making <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/last-online-5-years-ago">memes about experiences involving online friends they dont talk to anymore.</a></p>
