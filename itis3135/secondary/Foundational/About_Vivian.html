            <p>Although Vivian did not consider herself a digital artist until she was 17, She has always had a sincere love for visual arts and creation that spans all the way from her childhood. She feels as if she has had this feeling of creativity due to her first favorite cartoons being "Tom and Jerry" and "Pokemon". She has felt a sincere attachment to cute animals that led her to wanting to create her own show, with her only outlet being traditional art. After she obtained a printer to digitally scan her drawings onto her computer, she colorized them digitally. She was so proud of the results that it inspired her to pursue digital art as her primary hobby. She no longer wishes to create her own show, but intends to lend her skills to animation one day.</p>
            <p> While she doesnt produce full-scale artwork very often and doesnt consider herself a professional, her art work is personal to her special interests that others dont quite relate to. However, she has since formed an artistic identity for herself that has only led to a greater inspiration and motivation. She plans to continue developing her skill set through her college journey, her ultimate goal being a bachelor's degree in graphic design with additional skills in animation and 3d modeling.</p>
